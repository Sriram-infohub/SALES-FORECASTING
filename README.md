## üìà Project Workflow

The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Handling missing values, formatting, etc.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Understanding patterns, correlations, and insights.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Creating useful input variables for modeling.

4. **Model Building**  
   Applying ML algorithms like Linear Regression, XGBoost, etc.

5. **Evaluation**  
   Assessing model performance with RMSE, MAE, R¬≤, and visual plots.
